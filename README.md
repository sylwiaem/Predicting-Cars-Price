# Predicting-Cars-Price

The goal of this project is to predict a car's market price using k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The data set contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile).
